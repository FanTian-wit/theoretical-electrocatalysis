The cookbook of theoretical electrochemistry
============================================

In this project, we will summarize all the possible procedures for calculating certain properties (thermodynamic, dynamic, etc.) of electrochemical (electrocatalytic) systems.

About the toggle feature mentioned in the README.md will be shown in here (as example):
