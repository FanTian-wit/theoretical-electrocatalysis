The cookbook of theoretical electrochemistry
============================================

In this project, we will summarize all the possible procedures for calculating certain properties (thermodynamic, dynamic, etc.) of electrochemical (electrocatalytic) systems.

About the toggle feature mentioned in the README.md will be shown in here (as example):

.. note:: **Step 1**: Build the structure for your system.
   :class: dropdown, toggle-shown

   This is the test.

**Step 1**: Build the structure for your system.

.. toggle::

   This is an important toggle.

**Step 2**: Prepare the input file.

.. toggle::

   I think I can add more things in here.

   .. note::

      Maybe I can also add some notes in here.
