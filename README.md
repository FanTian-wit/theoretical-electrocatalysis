# theoretical-electrocatalysis
In this repository, we will summarise the procedure of theoretical simulation in electrocatalytic system, it will be a huge task, but it will be interesting to do in the lowdown.

## The purpose of this project
In theoretical electrocatalysis, there are many procedures and methodologies in order to get the information about certain systems, but these methods are not well-documented, and it is not easy for beginners to quickly learn these procedures, and often in literature they are not stated fully. So this project is established in order to solve this problem.

In this project, we will summarize all the most important procedures for getting the potential energy profiles, the activation energies, the different ways to do electronic structure analysis, and make them like a book from computer science, usually titled (The cookbook series). It could be useful for the beginners to learn how to do those simulations, and what is good about this project is that we will have some "sample" scripts, not the "extremely elementary" scripts from the tutorial session in the website of the software, but real-life examples of certain systems (could from the paper we have found on the internet.)

If you want to collaborate in the project, you can fork, and join me (maybe later I can change the "me" to "us").
